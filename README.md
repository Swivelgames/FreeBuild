The new cool stuff is Scala/Jython, and a little Java. Look at the .classpath to figure out what needs to be included, but off the top of my head, it's CSSBox, ANTLR4, libcrane (see my repository), GLG2D (my version), JNA, Jython 2.7, the Validator.nu HTML Parser, Slick-Util, and LWJGL. 

Recommend setting up scala-ide version of Eclipse, with the PyDev plugin for Jython.
