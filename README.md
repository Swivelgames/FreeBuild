Needs libRocket, glfw, and Python2.7, and Boost.Python, all built statically. Links against libstdc++, not libc++.
Also needs glload, but that's included because I had to tweak it for Mac. There are some other dependencies as well, 
but you should be able to figure them out based on what symbols it complains about.
